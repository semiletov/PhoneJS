# TipCalculator demo

A single-screen cross-platform HTML5 mobile application that provides a fast and convenient way of calculating tips for a check. Inputting a sum from a check, users get total tips, as well as totals and tips per each person.

The demo is built using the [PhoneJS mobile framework](http://phonejs.devexpress.com/). PhoneJS contains everything you need to create native client applications using HTML5 and JavaScript with a single codebase and deliver solutions that target iOS, Android, and Windows Phone 8.

This mobile application is a good illustration of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) structured approach. It can be launched in a mobile browser or turned into native packages ready for stores via packaging services, such as [PhoneGap Build](http://build.phonegap.com).
